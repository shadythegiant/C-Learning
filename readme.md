## About

This repository is a collection of my solutions to the challenges and exercises from a C programming course. Each challenge focuses on a specific concept, such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, pointers, and more. By solving these challenges, I aim to strengthen my understanding of C programming and improve my problem-solving skills.

This repo is primarily for personal use, but I've made it public in case it helps others who are learning C programming or working on similar challenges.
